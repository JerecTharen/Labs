 ## App Exercise - Password Entry and User Search
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 You think it might be fun to incorporate some friendly competition into your fitness tracking app. Users will be able to compete with friends in small fitness challenges. However, to do this users will need a password-protected account. Write an if-else statement below that will check that the entered user name and password match the stored user name and password. While the password should be case sensitive, users should be able to log in even if their entered user name has the wrong capitalization. If the user name and password match, print "You are now logged in!" Otherwise, print "Please check your user name and password and try again."

let storedUserName = "TheFittest11"
let storedPassword = "a8H1LuK91"
let enteredUserName = "thefittest11"
let enteredPassword: String = "a8H1Luk9"
if storedPassword != enteredPassword || storedUserName != enteredUserName {
    print("please check your username and password")

}
else if storedPassword == enteredPassword && storedUserName == enteredUserName {
    print("you are logged in!")
}
